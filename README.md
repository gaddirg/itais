# IT Assets Inventory System (ITAIS)

IT Assets Inventory System is a web application that can be used to manage inventory of IT assets from deployment up to decommissioning. The system can provide an overall overview of all the IT assets of the organization. It can also alert administrators on warranty expirations of machines that are included in the inventory.

The system is designed with a multi-office branch approach. Each office branch can have a set of users who will maintain their IT inventories. Using this system, the company will have an overall picture of its IT resources allowing them to formulate strategies on how to manage the life-cycle of these resources.
